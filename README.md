# Flutter Bloc Card Flip

Not really any other way to describe this, an exercise in exploring a card flipping action on a board of cards using Flutter BloC state management.

Source code for [https://alienspaces.github.io/flutter-bloc-card-flip/](https://alienspaces.github.io/flutter-bloc-card-flip/)

## TODO

- Implement a card "board" with various functions
  - Shuffle deck (choose deck count)
  - Game type (match cards, labyrinth)
- GitlabCI pipeline (hell, why not..)
