Not really any other way to describe this, an exercise in exploring a card flipping action on a board of cards using Flutter BloC state management.

## Web Application

## CI/CD

All merges to the `master` branch run through automated tests followed by an automated web build and push to the `publish` branch which contains the current source for the above mentioned web application!

Push from local with automated production deployment as you would expect!
